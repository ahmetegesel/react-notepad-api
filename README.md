# React Notepad API
This is a supporting repo for 
[React Notepad](https://github.com/ahmetegesel/react-notepad) to have
a basic API implementation.

This repo may not reflect sufficient best-practices. All it is responsible
for is to provide the React Notepad app data to play around data fetching 
operations with.
